      <h3 class="instructors">The best marketing is when you don’t know it’s marketing.</h3>
      <p class="cushion">Marketing today is defined by how useful it is to your customers. And the bar of what’s useful has risen substantially. Where blog posts, infographics, and webinars were once marketing gold, websites, apps, and tools are taking over.</p>
      <p>If you’re trying to get a new idea off the ground, you must aim to create extreme value with your marketing. This is the only way to cut through the clutter of today.</p>
      <p><a href="https://crew.co/labs/">Our company, Crew, doubled its revenue every year for three years</a>, mainly from building tools that create value. It worked for us. And with the help of some awesome folks we're going to teach you everything we know.</p>
